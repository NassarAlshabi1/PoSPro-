# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 2026*

## 1. Introduction

PoSPro is a decentralized, secure Point of Sale (PoS) solution developed by **REChain Network Solutions** using Flutter, Dart, and related open-source technologies.

This Privacy Policy explains how data is processed, stored, and protected when using PoSPro software, including client applications, self-hosted backends, and optional integrations.

PoSPro follows the principles of **privacy by design**, **data minimization**, and **operator control**.

## 2. Scope of This Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to:

* PoSPro client applications (mobile, desktop, terminal)
* Self-hosted PoSPro servers or nodes
* Open-source repositories under REChain Network Solutions related to PoSPro

This policy does **not** apply to third-party services, payment providers, banking systems, or fiscal operators that may be integrated by merchants or operators.

## 3. Key Privacy Principles

* **No mandatory central server**: PoSPro can be deployed in fully self-hosted or decentralized environments.
* **Merchant-controlled data**: Transaction and customer data remain under the control of the merchant or system operator.
* **Minimal data collection**: Only data strictly necessary for transaction processing is handled.
* **Transparency**: PoSPro source code is publicly available for audit.

## 4. Data We Do Not Collect

By default, REChain Network Solutions does **not** collect:

* Customer personal identification data
* Payment card numbers or CVV codes
* Biometric data
* Advertising or tracking identifiers
* Behavioral analytics for marketing purposes

## 5. Data That May Be Processed

Depending on configuration and applicable law, PoSPro **may process**:

* Transaction metadata (amounts, timestamps, order identifiers)
* Product or service information
* Tax or fiscal data required by local regulation
* Technical logs required for system reliability and security

Sensitive payment data is processed only by **external certified payment providers**, not by PoSPro itself.

## 6. Payments and Third-Party Services

PoSPro may integrate with:

* Banks and acquiring services
* Payment gateways
* Fiscal data operators (OFD)
* Accounting or ERP systems

These services operate under their own privacy policies. PoSPro does not control or assume responsibility for third-party data handling.

## 7. Data Storage and Retention

* Data is stored locally, on merchant-controlled servers, or within infrastructure chosen by the operator
* Retention periods are defined by merchant policy and applicable law
* REChain Network Solutions does not have automatic access to merchant data

## 8. Security Measures

PoSPro implements security best practices, including:

* Encrypted communication channels
* Role-based access control
* Optional cryptographic signing and verification
* Open-source security review

Despite these measures, no system can guarantee absolute security.

## 9. Operator and Merchant Responsibilities

Merchants and system operators are responsible for:

* Compliance with local data protection laws (GDPR, 152-ФЗ, PCI DSS where applicable)
* Secure configuration and operation of PoSPro deployments
* Obtaining customer consent where required

## 10. Children’s Privacy

PoSPro is not intended for use by children and does not knowingly collect data related to minors.

## 11. International Use

PoSPro may be used globally. Data processing locations depend on where the merchant or operator deploys the system.

Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with local regulations.

## 12. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated as PoSPro evolves.

* Updates will be published via the GitHub repository
* Continued use of the software indicates acceptance of the revised policy

**PoSPro** is built for secure commerce — with privacy and control remaining in the hands of businesses.
